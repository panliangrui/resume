Liangrui Pan (Student Member, IEEE) was born in Anhui, China, in 1997. He is currently pursuing thePh.D’s degree in computer science with the Hunan University, China. His research interests include Artificial intelligence, Medical Image Analysis, Bioinformatics. He is also a member of the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering. In terms of academic performance, I passed all the exams in the selected courses and obtained an average GPA of 3.76 in all courses. 

In academic innovation, During my PhD (supervisor: [Shaoliang Peng](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/pengshaoliang)) and master's degree (supervisor: [Mitchai Chongcheawchamnan](https://grad.psu.ac.th/en/faculty-staff/lecturer.html?tid=724)), I published and accepted a total of 20 high-level English papers, which were cited 250 times by [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=-zSEPX0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Among them, I have published a total of 20 articles as the first author and co-author in IEEE Sensors Journal, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Health Information Science and Systems, and Journal of Raman Spectroscopy; in CCF B Published 5 papers at IEEE BIBM; one of them received the highest number of downloads in the Journal of Raman Spectroscopy. Under the public review status, the tutor has 10 patents for his works, Authorize 1 software copyright.
